\title{Calculate Empirical Intensity Using Wavelet Coefficients}
\usage{
get_empirical_intensity(x, indx_lst)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of counts with a length that is a power of 2 (i.e., 2^S for some integer S).}

\item{indx_lst}{A list of indices generated by `fsusieR::gen_wavelet_indx`, which maps the wavelet coefficients to the appropriate positions in the vector.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\item{Y_min}{A numeric vector of the same length as `x`, containing the minimal empirical intensity at each scale.}
\item{Y_tot}{A numeric vector of the same length as `x`, containing the total empirical intensity at each scale.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the empirical intensity from a vector of counts by utilizing wavelet-based indexing. It is specifically designed to work with the `fsusieR` routines.
}
\details{
The function sorts the intensity in the same order as the `wavethresh` package, allowing compatibility with `fsusieR` routines. It processes the input vector of counts according to the wavelet coefficients and returns the minimal and total empirical intensities for each scale.

\examples{
# Example usage
library(fsusieR)
x <- c(4, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
indx_lst <- fsusieR::gen_wavelet_indx(log2(length(x)))
result <- get_empirical_intensity(x, indx_lst)

print(result$Y_min)
print(result$Y_tot)
